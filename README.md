# REPL

REPL is like a node command line. It stands for:
* Read - Reads user's input, parse the input into JavaScript data-structure and * stores in memory.
* Eval - Takes and evaluates the data structure
* Print - Prints the result
* Loop - Loops the above command until user press ctrl-c twice.

It can be used to debug.
